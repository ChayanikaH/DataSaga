This repository contains all of the independent project done by me in Business Intelligence & Visualization.

### Project 1 - Data Visualization - 80 cererals
This is my first independent project, aimed at visualizing cereals and their composition to gain insights into the cereal market.

#### Objective - 
The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the nutritional composition of cereals to identify patterns, compare their health benefits, and determine which product can be classified as the "healthiest." Additionally, this case study aims to develop a scoring system or criteria for ranking cereals based on their nutritional profiles and ratings.

#### Goal - 
The goal is to provide actionable insights for cereal manufacturers to enhance their product offerings and cater to the needs of health-conscious consumers while empowering individuals to make informed choices. Through this analysis, the findings could influence marketing strategies, product innovation, and nutritional labeling practices.

#### The analysis is conducted in a Python notebook utilizing the NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries.

### Methodology 
Step 1 : Importing the warnings and required libraries
Step 2 : Understanding of the Dataset
Step 3 : Univariate Analysis
Step 4 : Bivariate Analysis
Step 5 : Overall Analysis
Step 6 : Feature Importance using Random Forest
Step 7 : Conclusion and Recommendation


#### Conclusion and Recomendation

Consumers are increasingly prioritizing healthier breakfast cereals with high fiber, low sugar, and whole grains, as evidenced by the top ratings of brands like All-Bran and Shredded Wheat.

Analysis reveals that sugar and calorie content are the most influential factors in cereal ratings, showcasing growing health consciousness. While fiber and sodium also impact preferences, attributes like protein, fat, and vitamins hold less sway. 

Brands with sugary cereals, like Frosted Flakes and Trix, receive lower ratings, highlighting the shift towards mindful eating. Cereal manufacturers can capitalize on these insights by focusing on fiber-rich, low-sugar options to meet consumer demand for healthier choices.
